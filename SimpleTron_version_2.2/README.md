# SimpleTron<br />
The SimpleTron is a machine for entering and running programs written in SML (Simple Machine Language).
SML is a simple low-level language which has similarities with Assembly Languages. 
SML programs are entered into a Virtual Memory space by the user either from the 
keyboard one line at a time, or by loading them from a file with an .sml suffix. 
The SimpleTron allows users to enter, run programs, and write out the contents 
of the Registers and Virtual Memory to the Screen or a Dump File.<br /><br />
